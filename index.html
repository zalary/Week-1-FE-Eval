              Our mission is "to educate and prepare girls for a lifetime of self-respect and healthy living." Girls on the Run (GOTR) is a prevention program that uses the power of running to help preteen girls in 3rd through 8th grade develop self-respect and value a healthy lifestyle. Our curricula address the development of the 'whole' girl - her physical, emotional, mental, social and spiritual well-being.</p></div>
            <div class="large-6 columns"><h2>Non-Profit</h2><p>
            GOTR of Austin is a 501(c)(3) non-profit community collaboration and is funded by registration fees, tax-deductible donations and grants. We rely entirely on the generosity and support of local individuals, businesses and organizations. Without the support of the greater Austin area, we would not exist. <br />We thank you all!</p>

<!-- put this somewhere else? <p>GOTR of Austin is an affiliate of Girls on the Run International, which has a network of 160 locations across the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>GOTR of Austin is also now a part of Local Independent Charities of America, a federation of local nonprofit charitable organizations that are helping children and many others in communities.</p> --></div>

    <h2>Kristi (KB) Schatz</h2>
    <p>KB is originally from St. Paul, MN and has lived in Austin for 2 years - most recently moving from Chicago, IL, where she was actively involved in Girls on the Run of Chicago as a coach for 3 years. Since discovering the power and inspiration of the Girls on the Run program, KB has been an advocate and supporter of the GOTR mission. At the age of 28, KB ran her first race, the Minneapolis "Turkey Trot". Each year she challenges herself with a new race goal by signing up for something she's never done before. Her racing calendar regularly includes many 5K, 10K, bike races, half marathons, and triathlons. When she ran the Chicago Marathon she did so as part of the Team Tiara (now called SoleMates), fundraising in support of Girls on the Run. </p>

<p>KB has worked for the same company for 10 years and currently works with Architects and Interior Designers in Austin and San Antonio, specifying commercial interior products. She has her BA in Speech Communications and Marketing from Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota.</p>

<p>In her words, "Growing up I was not an active adolescent, and I wish the program had been offered when my confidence, self-esteem and athletics were lacking and in need of encouragement. Ever since I started running I have embraced the power it provides me. I have seen first-hand how Girls on the Run gives young girls self-confidence. The gift of working with the girls on their goals and seeing the delight in their eyes throughout the season is truly amazing."</p>
